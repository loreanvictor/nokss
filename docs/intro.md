**nokss** is a drop-in stylesheet that works out of the box. Instead of reyling on CSS classes, **nokss** uses the semantics of HTML itself to figure out how to style various elements: a button is styled like a button, a link like a link, etc. This means you can use **nokss** without needing to change your HTML at all.

**nokss** is designed for prototyping, blogs, articles, small projects, etc. Basically any use case where semantic HTML is enough for distinguishing various elements. It can be further extended for more complex use cases, however that is not a top priority for this project.

Other features:

- **nokss** is fully responsive.
- **nokss** supports dark mode.
- **nokss** is customizable through CSS variables.
- **nokss** is pretty tiny.

Except a few specific elements, this document is styled with **nokss** itself, and acts as a preview. You can also change the theme in [Theming](#theming) section to see how it would look with other themes.
