**nokss** is a drop-in stylesheet that works out of the box: no need for CSS classes or special attributes. Instead, **nokss** relies on semantics of HTML itself to figure out how to style various elements: a button is styled like a button, a link like a link, etc.

**nokss** is designed for prototyping, blogs, articles, small projects, etc. Basically any use case where semantic HTML is enough for distinguishing various elements. It can be further extended for more complex use cases, however that is not a top priority for this project.
