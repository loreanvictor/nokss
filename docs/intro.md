_nokss_ is a drop-in stylesheet that works out of the box. No need to use CSS classes: just write plain, semantic HTML, and _nokss_ will style it for you (as much as it can). _nokss_ is designed for prototyping, blogs, articles, small projects, etc. Basically any use case where semantic HTML is enough for distinguishing various elements. It can be further extended for more complex use cases, however that is not a top priority for this project.

Other features:

- Fully responsive.
- Supports dark mode out of the box.
- Customizable through CSS variables.

Except a few specific elements, this document is styled with _nokss_ itself, and acts as a preview. You can also change the theme in [Theming](#theming) section to see how it would look with other themes.
