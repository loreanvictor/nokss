# Usage

nokss works out of the box and styles elements based on their semantics rather than classes or attributes. You don't
need to use any classes (like `.btn` or `.container`) to use its styles. Because nokss relies on HTML semantics for properly
styling elements, the more senantic your HTML is, the more you'll get out of it. In the following section, the semantics
that nokss looks for are described for each element / element type.
