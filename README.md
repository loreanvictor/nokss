**nokss** is a drop-in stylesheet that works out of the box. Instead of relying on CSS classes, **nokss** uses the semantics of HTML itself to figure out how to style various elements: a button is styled like a button, a link like a link, etc. This means you can use **nokss** without needing to change your HTML at all.

To use **nokss**, simply include this line in your CSS:

```css
@import 'https://unpkg.com/nokss/dist/nokss.css';
```

And thats it! Write your HTML and **nokss** takes care of styling. The more semantic your HTML is, i.e. the more you use elements such as `<button>`, `<menu>`, `<aside>`, instead of just using `<div>`s everywhere, and the more you assign correct ARIA roles and attributes to them, the more **nokss** can do for you.
